To use a bot, it must be registered and approved; it must adhere to the rules of the client's lisence and all your code must be open source. If you find a bug in the game, you must tell the owners of Eternal Lands immediately.
*Illegal multi-playing includes but is not limited to: muling, deathbag sitting, pvp training, luring people to pk maps with a newbie chararacter while lying in wait with another. Also note that it is very difficult to be able to define each and every form of illegal multi-playing or cheating, so these matters will be reveiwed and punishments decided upon on a case by case basis.</long>

		<short>Use Appropriate Names.</short>
		<long>Please do not create a name that is obscene, vulgar, profane, offensive, is utterly senseless and stupid (e.g. dfjritq47fa), or is made with the intent of impersonation.

Amount of non-alphabetic characters can never exceed the amount of letters, and is limited to 2 maximum.

		<long>Breaking these rules or the spirit of the rules (not just the letter of the law) is punishable. Usually there will be given a warning first. This does not apply for repeat offenders or severe offenses that require immediate action. If this warning does not work and the infraction continues, players can be muted, kicked, booted, even banned (in no specific order) depending on the crime, the severity of the crime and the judgment of any of the moderators. The higher the level a mod is that has to deal with you, the higher your punishment can be.</long>
