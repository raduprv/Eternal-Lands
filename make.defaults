#FEATURES += USE_SIMD			# Enables usage of simd instructions

### Machine specific options (fixes or performance enhancements) ###
#FEATURES += EL_BIG_ENDIAN		# Enable big-endian code (automatically detected for OSX)
#FEATURES += NO_PF_MACRO		# Use a function instead of a macro for pf_get_tile()
#FEATURES += SIMPLE_LOD			# enable a simplistic distance culling to improve performance
#FEATURES += SOUND_FORK_BUGFIX	# needed for current linux static build to prevent crash when forking in url.c after F2 press and sound/music enabled
#FEATURES += USE_ALGETSOURCEI_AL_BUFFER	# disable to workaround issue with newer openal versions (also works on older versions), enable to restore original usage of alGetSourcei(pSource->source, AL_BUFFER, &buffer) for sound

### Debug options ###

#FEATURES += EXTRA_DEBUG		# (undocumented)
#FEATURES += MEMORY_DEBUG		# gather information about memory allocation and freeing
#FEATURES += MISSILES_DEBUG		# Enables debug for missiles feature. It will create a file missiles_log.txt file in your settings directory.
