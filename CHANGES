	Map updates
		The client now comes with a default tab map for every map, not just select ones.
		Morcraven Marsh - New "Market" area next to the battle hall for bots. (All bots in or near this area need to make a new home in one of the 30 stalls as quickly as possible.)
		Isla Prima - New semi-secret map "Newbie Dream Temple" for brand new players. (If you're helping new players, you're free to tell them how to get into this. Even in public chat.)
		Imbroglio Islands - New island "Hadlioth Isle".
		Imbroglio Islands - Moglo northern (no-pk) fort moved
		Thelinor - The formerly-secret dangerous "Brick Palace" is no longer a secret. You still need a Brick to enter it, but the entrance is no longer secret, having been moved to Thelinor city, inside the "volcano"-type thing just south of storage in the city.
		Thelinor - A new safe (non-pk) small cave near the Zirak exit, using a door that was already there but previously unused.
		Kusamura Jungle - The entrance to the temple is no longer a secret, as it is now entered via an addition to the main map. (Note: The questions inside are still considered secrets though.)
		Kusamura Jungle - The temple has been overhauled to go with this change, and is now a temple for the shadow goddess Varyssa, goddess of enchantment, who affects people's imaginations and creativity, along with their dreams. (Read more about her: http://www.eternal-lands.com/forum/index.php?/topic/45289-varyssa/ )
		Token Map - Overhauled to remove the nasty snapdragon/rose mess on the west side. Replaced with a beach decor that's less likely to cause grue and gives more space for invasions. Includes 2 new minor insides.
		Idaloran - The area between Jahir Beach and Nymorq Woods is now a ruins area in keeping with the original Idaloran storyline. One new minor enterable hut can be found among the ruins.
		Idaloran - New cathedral building in the northwest area within the city walls. ("Insides" of three buildings removed for this are still available, attached to buildings elsewhere in the city.)
		Idaloran - new bridge west of the castle leading towards Irsis exit
		Irsis - Due to an increase in exports from Irsis, the previously unused ships at the docks are now available for travel! There's ships that lead to four more maps. Each of those four maps now have ships that lead back to Irsis as well.
		Zirakinbar - All 3 wagons on the map can now be entered, includes the one next to storage.
		Zirakinbar - 4 teleport pads added for getting around the map
		Zirakinbar - A few harvestables adjusted to improve storage walk, including one that makes this a slightly better map for stocking honeycomb than Palon Vertas. (However it comes with a much higher risk for Leonard at night.)
		North Zirakgunda - The gnomes who call Zirakgunda home have discovered silver ore in a previously unchecked part of North Gunda near the plant growing room.
		Irinveron - The southwest teleport pad leading to northeast Irin moved a bit more towards storage for improved use as a path from storage to Waveneck caves in Glacmor.
		Irinveron - The huge "harvesting cave" now has carts and tracks for getting around it quicker.
		Aeth Aelfan - Wyrmgoth cave has 4 teleport spots added for getting around the map
		Aeth Aelfan - levers added to gate directly north of storage to "use" to go through gate
		Aeth Aelfan Lothalith Fortress - Has a new room addition.
		Trassian Dra Syn Caves - One cave is expanded and redesigned.
		Whitestone - House in Northern Woods just east of the city walls is now enterable.
		Portland - House next to blueberries east of the city walls is now enterable.
		Sedicolis - Eveline's tent can be entered.
		Nordcarn South Cave - House south of amber (with fruit next to it) can be entered.
		South Redmoon - House with garden behind it (north of storage) can be entered.
		C2 Portal Room - fourth same-map teleport that goes to the northern-most row of portals (cold maps), and some minor tweaks for mapwalking improvement
		Bethel - The two small caves that were "You try to enter, but a barrier blocks you" secrets are no longer secret, and can be entered normally. (The secrets made no sense, nor did they serve any purpose on a map with plenty of secrets already.)
		Melinis has a new secret path, may or may not be useful if discovered. (Or more correctly, a 1-way secret was turned into a tweaked 2-way path.)
		Appearantly there's a new, very silly secret location on C2.
	Minor Additional Map Changes
		South Redmoon - at 273,238 - "eye" the tombstone for a memorial to Looter / Hydroman.
		All Fast Read and Fast Regen locations are now the same speed. (Only the ones closest to sto were used anyway)
		Every storage now has a no-summoning zone placed around them. (This will be most noticeable in Naralik where that rule was more commonly violated.)
		EVTR Mine - one emerald harv spot that was directly in a common walk path removed. Emeralds there moved to other nearby spots.
		Naralik - For the house next to storage, click the door now to enter instead of the whole house (reduce misclicks while mixing at or going to storage)
		Grubani Insides / DP Crystal Caves Insides map - Has had decoration changes and is now fully harvestable (for pear hunting purposes).
		Irinveron, Whitestone, etc. - some tree reduction in various parts of the map
		Two secret places got all their exits completely redone...
		Morcraven Marsh cave - Minor redesign to kill the bottleneck of players in a single silver spot
		A few places have gotten some more decoration (North Zirakgunda and AA Smuggler's Cave are a couple examples)
		Some basic cleanup and decor fixes (not relevant to gameplay) on many maps
		more height tiling (where you can walk) fixes on most every map
		For pear hunters: more harvestables that were stuck inside rocks or underground have either been moved to be visible or just removed in many maps, including VotD gold cave, MM silver, AA Wyrmgoth (huge improvement for diamonds), Thelinor + Theli caves, and more. No guarantee all were found but the overwhelming majority should be fixed.

Maps:

* There are quite a few new caves and buildings, some benign and some designed to be useful. (Won't be discussed as there may be contests to find them and such.)
* Some old locations that were "removed" have also been tweaked or redesigned to fix the problems and re-added. A couple were just deleted, deemed beyond hope of repair.
* A couple big changes to current maps as well.
* Every single map in the game has been gone over with a careful eye multiple times, tweaked and adjusted to be as correct as possible. This includes:
	- Fixing where you can walk. Areas that shouldn't be walkable like under rocks and such have been removed, while areas that should be walkable (you click but you can't go there) are.
	- General design fixes (floating objects, items just poorly placed or stuck in other items they shouldn't be stuck in, etc.)
	- An incredible amount of work has been done to reduce flickering of items seen when the camera is moved. (May never be 100%, but a good chunk of it's fixed.)
	- Enter locations fixed that cause you to walk in odd directions when you click to use them. Exit drop locations fixed where you end up in an odd corner instead of directly at the entrance door/cave/etc.
	- Most all harvestables that are in a harvestable area are now actually reachable, where design allowed. (Some placed as decor-only and are not allowed to be harved on that map remain that way.)
	- Some harvestables stuck inside cave walls and such brought out. (This being a very time-consuming and difficult task, it was not done 100%, but I got to what I could.) This will be why when you visit some harv spots you know, there may be more ores or minerals or such there than were before. Those were always there, just hidden in the walls.
(While most work done of this nature on current maps won't be visibly noticeable, it will be in some areas. Nothing drastic in these cases, so I call them "easter eggs". ;-) )
And of course, all reported bugs fixed.

Some minor points that can be discussed (these only go into effect when 1.9.4 is released, not before):
	- Palon Vertas main map will be multi-combat (currently single)
	- The Whitestone crafting school will work
	- Both Zirakinbar schools (manu school on the east side near docks, craft school area near EP exit) work
	- Trassian Manufacturing school (southwest corner of Trassian) works
	- The entire inside-the-stands area of the KJ temple arena will be PK, not just an unmarked square in the middle of it.
	- Mount Sorrow in SRM is harvestable.
	- The dung portal room has had flags placed above each outhouse indicating where they lead. You can "eye" the flags for specific info, or if you don't know the map flags (shame on you)

Misc:

* Heavily updated (English) Encyclopedia and book/knowledge list
